Fantasmic Forms
===============

Fantasmic Forms is an intuitive and adaptable web application tailored to streamline XML data input for D&D Virtual Tabletops (VTTs). With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, users can effortlessly generate custom elements to enhance their adventures. The platform enables the creation of various elements such as:

- Action: Representing creature actions with optional parameters, like 'Bite' with 'AttackMod' and 'Damage'.
- Lair: Designating a monster's habitat or lair.
- Legendary Action: Defining unique actions specific to legendary creatures.
- Monster: Comprising creature statistics, actions, traits, etc., whether they're singular NPCs or swarms.
- PlayerCharacter: Providing essential player character data for Dungeon Masters.
- Reaction: Capturing creature reactions, such as 'Parry'.
- Spell: Documenting spells ranging from cantrips to level 9, such as 'Magic Missile'.
- Trait: Detailing creature traits, like 'Action Surge'.

Fantasmic Forms also allows users to import a Core Data File containing pre-defined elements for reference or template use. Once new elements are created using the 'Add <element>' button, they can be conveniently downloaded with a user-provided filename and seamlessly imported into their VTT system."
